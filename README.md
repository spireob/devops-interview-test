# DevOps Interview Test

This repository contains two short simple troubleshooting exercises.

The goal of the test is to run the Ansible playbook and install the Helm chart, identify and fix the errors that have been intentionally introduced.

Fork this repository into your own GitHub account, push all the fixes required to resolve the issues to your fork and provide the URL to your contact in HR.

We will discuss the results of the test in the face-to-face interview.

## Prerequisites

* A CentOS 7 machine with Ansible installed
* Access to a Kubernetes cluster or Docker for Desktop installed
* kubectl and helm installed on your local machine

## Ansible

The Ansible playbook installs ActiveMQ on the local system and configures it as a service.

To run the playbook execute the following commands:

```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook playbooks/acs.yml -i inventory
```

The playbook will fail with a couple of different errors, your challenge is to identify and fix the errors.
Also make sure that activeMQ is acctually running at the end of the ansible run.

## Kubernetes

The [Helm chart](helm/alfresco-content-services/README.md) installs Postrges, ActiveMQ and the Alfresco repository.

To deploy the Helm chart execute the following commands:

```bash
kubectl create namespace devops-test
cd helm
helm dependency update alfresco-content-services
helm install acs alfresco-content-services -n devops-test
```

Although the Helm install command appears to work the deployment will actually fail with a couple of different errors, your challenge is to identify and fix the errors.

Once the system is running successfully the Alfresco repository will be available at `http://NodeIp:NodePort/alfresco`. If you are using a cluster that does not expose the worker nodes to the outside world the service won't be accessible. By adding to this README please also describe what other techniques you could use to access the Alfresco repository.
